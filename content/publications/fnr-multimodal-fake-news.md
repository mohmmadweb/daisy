  The availability and interactive nature of social media have made them the primary
  source of news around the globe. The popularity of social media tempts criminals to
  pursue their immoral intentions by producing and disseminating fake news using seductive
  text and misleading images. This work analyses multi-modal features from texts and
  images in social media for detecting fake news. We propose a Fake News Revealer (FNR)
  method that uses transfer learning to extract contextual and semantic features and
  contrastive loss to determine the similarity between image and text. Applied to two real
  social media datasets, FNR achieves higher accuracy in detecting fake news compared to
  previous work.

A fake news post is rarely fake in one modality alone. FNR looks at the relationship between what a post says and what its image shows: transformer encoders extract contextual and semantic features from each modality, and a contrastive objective measures how well the two agree.

That agreement signal is what separates FNR from classifiers that treat text and image as two independent feature bags.
