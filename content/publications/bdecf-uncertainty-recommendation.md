  Most well-known recommendation models employ representation learning to map users and
  items into a unified embedding space for matching assessment. These approaches have
  primary limitations, especially with explicit feedback and sparse data: proneness to
  overfitting and failure to incorporate epistemic uncertainty in predictions. We propose
  a Bayesian Deep Ensemble Collaborative Filtering method named BDECF. To improve model
  generalisation and quality, we use Bayesian neural networks, which incorporate
  uncertainty within their weight parameters, and introduce an interpretable non-linear
  matching approach for user and item embeddings leveraging the attention mechanism. We
  further endorse an ensemble-based supermodel to generate more robust and reliable
  predictions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across public real-world
  datasets with differing sparsity confirm the method's effectiveness.

Recommenders trained on sparse explicit feedback are confidently wrong in exactly the places where they have seen the least data. BDECF addresses that directly: weights are Bayesian, so the model carries epistemic uncertainty, and an ensemble of such models produces predictions that can be trusted or discounted according to how much the members disagree.

The matching function between user and item embeddings is attention-based and non-linear, which also makes the match interpretable.
