  Access to complete data in large-scale networks is often infeasible, so missing data is
  an unavoidable issue in the analysis of real-world social networks. In this paper, a
  model is learned from partially observed data to infer unobserved diffusion and
  structure networks. To jointly discover omitted diffusion activities and hidden network
  structures, we develop a probabilistic generative model called DiffStru. The
  interrelations among links of nodes and cascade processes are utilised via learning
  coupled low-dimensional latent factors. Besides inferring unseen data, latent factors
  such as community detection may also aid in network classification problems. Experiments
  on simulated independent cascades over LFR networks and on real datasets including
  Twitter and Memetracker show that the proposed method successfully detects invisible
  social behaviours, predicts links, and identifies latent features.

DiffStru treats the two things we usually cannot observe — who is connected to whom, and which diffusion events actually happened — as a single joint problem rather than two separate ones.

The model couples low-dimensional latent factors across the link structure and the cascade process, so evidence about one side constrains the other. The same factors turn out to be useful beyond imputation: they carry community structure that can be reused for classification.
