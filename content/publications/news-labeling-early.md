abstract: >-
  The time gap between a news item's release and the detection of its label is a
  significant step towards broadcasting real information and avoiding fake news, but there
  is a trade-off between minimising that gap and maximising accuracy. We focus on accurate
  early labelling of news and propose a model that considers earliness both in modelling
  and in prediction, using recurrent neural networks with a novel loss function and a new
  stopping rule. Given the context of the news, we first embed it with a class-specific
  text representation, then use the available public profile of users and the speed of
  news diffusion for early labelling. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate
  effectiveness in both earliness and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Detecting fake news accurately is easier the longer you wait, and useless if you wait too long. This paper makes that trade-off explicit: earliness enters both the loss function and the stopping rule, so the model decides when it has seen enough of a cascade to commit to a label.

The signals are the text of the news, the public profiles of the users spreading it, and the speed of its diffusion.
