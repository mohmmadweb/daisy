Most data in an organisation is locked behind a query language that few of its people write. Text-to-SQL promises to remove that barrier, but a model that produces plausible SQL is not enough: the query has to be correct against a schema it has never seen, it has to run efficiently, and the system has to recognise when a question is ambiguous or unanswerable.

We work on the parts of that problem where data, not model size, is the bottleneck: schema representation and linking, synthesising training data that reflects real schemas, execution-grounded evaluation, and calibration so a system can say "I am not sure" rather than return a wrong table.
